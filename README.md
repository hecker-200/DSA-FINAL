# _**Route Logic**_

This repository is the culmination of our Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course project. This project showcases our understanding and application of fundamental DSA concepts through an interactive web-based platform.

## **_🚀 Project Overview_**

This project is a web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It serves as an educational tool for visualizing and interacting with various data structures and algorithms, enhancing comprehension through practical implementation.

## **_📁 Repository Structure_**

- `index.html` — The main HTML file structures the web page.
- `style.css` — Contains the styling rules to enhance the visual presentation of the web application.
- `script.js` — Implements the core functionality, including the logic for data structures and algorithms.

## **_🧠 Features_**

- Interactive visualization of data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
- Step-by-step execution of algorithms to demonstrate their inner workings.
- User-friendly interface to input data and observe algorithm behavior.
- Responsive design to ensure compatibility across various devices.

## **_🛠️ Tools Used_**

- **HTML5** — For structuring the content of the web application.
- **CSS3** — For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6)** — For implementing interactive features and algorithm logic.
